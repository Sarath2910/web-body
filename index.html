                <p> “Business Development Executive,” “Manager of Business Development,” and “VP, Business Development” are all impressive 
                    job titles often heard in business organizations. 
                    Sales, strategic initiatives, business partnerships, market development, business expansion, and marketing—all of these fields are
                     involved in business development but are often mixed up and mistakenly viewed as the sole function of business development.
